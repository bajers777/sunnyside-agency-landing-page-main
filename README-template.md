### What I learned

In this project I mostly use flexbox and this was main feature I want to learn. This is also my first (so far) completed project where I have to stick a very exact guidelines - primary and secondary site colors, typography, etc. Before that I used GIMP to "slice" template and search Google Fonts for right typography which was a bad habit.

I made progress in learning Media Queries, this is something new to me because before I mostly used Bootstrap without knowledge of Media Queries and sometimes I wasn't able to understand how BS works or why it doesn't. More luck than skills. This is milestone for my study, I'm looking forward to use more often Media Queries.

### Continued development

In the next project I want to learn CSS animations and I want to use more JS. I'll back to this one in future and I'll add some new features:
- smooth "hamburger menu" animation,
- animations in <section> and <articles>,
- cookies pop up messenges show up in next few second after user visit website,
- animated slider,
- JS gallery.

### Useful resources
